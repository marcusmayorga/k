  				 	<h3>What is a chemical peel?</h3>  				 	
  					<div>
					  <p>A chemical peel is an acid solution that is applied to the skin. It dissolves the outermost layer of skin cells, which then peels off over the following days to reveal the fresher, younger layer below. Peels are very effective in treating a large range of skin concerns such as aging, sun damage, acne, mild scarring, improving skin brightness, and evening skin tone. </p>
   					  <p>Peels can be light, moderate or deep. Light peels require no down time from work and your normal activities. Moderate peels may require a day or two, and deep peels can require a week or more of down time to allow the skin to fully heal. Estheticians who are not working in a medical setting perform light to moderate peels only. Deep peels can only be performed by a physician, or under a physician’s supervision, for your safety.</p>
  					</div>
 			     	<h3>Preparing for chemical peel treatment</h3>
  					<div>
    				  <p>Most skin colors and types can benefit from chemical peels, though it is best to check with your esthetician about which peel might be right for you. If you’re taking acne medication, Retin-A or Accutane, talk to your esthetician and/or doctor about stopping the medication before and during treatment to avoid complications. </p><p>Your esthetician can review any other contraindications with you prior to your treatment to determine if a chemical peel is right for you. Be sure to answer all questions honestly and completely on your consultation form prior to your peel.</p>
  					</div>
  					<h3>Chemical peel. What to expect ? </h3>
  					<div>
   					  <p>The skin is cleansed and a prep solution will be applied to remove surface oils and allow the peel to penetrate the skin evenly. Any sensitive areas that cannot be treated will be protected with a thin film of petroleum jelly. One or more chemical mixtures will be applied, such as glycolic acid (from sugar cane), trichloroacetic acid, salicylic acid, lactic acid (from
					  milk), or a combination peel called a Jessners peel. The peel will be applied in 1–3 layers, depending on the depth of penetration intended.
					  </p><p> The acids react with the skin to produce a “controlled wound,” allowing fresh skin to regenerate and emerge. A tingling, burning or hot sensation is normal. Most peels remain on the skin for a short time and are closely watched by the esthetician. A fan may help you stay more comfortable. After some peels, a neutralizing solution is applied to stop the peel. Other peels are self-timed and stop on their own.</p>
   				    </div>
  					<h3>After the peel</h3>
  					<div>
  					  <p>After most peels, the skin will be pink to red, and look shiny and tight. It is vital to apply sunscreen of SFP 30 or greater to the skin for the next 48 hours, minimum. You must also stay out of the sun, as your skin will be very sensitive to UV rays and could be damaged by sun exposure. The skin may begin to flake or peel within 2–3 days after the treatment, unless you had a lactic acid peel—these encourage moisture retention and may not produce any actual peeling.</p><p> Sun-damaged areas of your skin will appear darker at first, then will lighten. This is normal. Deeper peels can produce peeling for a week or more. To assist in removing the flaking skin, an enzyme peel or light microdermabrasion treatment is sometimes scheduled a week or so after the initial peel. For maximum results, a series of peels is usually  recommended, and may be necessary for treating challenging issues such as
					  hyperpigmentation.</p>     
 					 </div> 
  	  	         	  <h3>Home care after a chemical peel</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Your esthetician will recommend healing products to use for the week or two following your peel. These will soothe and nourish your skin, and aid in its recovery. Usually it is best to avoid makeup during this time, to allow the skin to heal and function without interference. However, if you must wear makeup, mineral makeup will not adversely affect the skin. </p>     
 					 </div> 
		  	  	      <h3>What is a facial? Why do I need one?</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>A facial is a professional cleansing, purifying, and beautifying treatment of the skin on the face and neck. Facials are the number one treatment performed by estheticians, and a good way for your therapist to get a good understanding of your skin prior to suggesting more aggressive treatments. </p><p>For most people, facials can be scheduled every four weeks, although your therapist may recommend a different schedule. There are many variations of facials based on different needs, as well as different lengths of time.. Tell your esthetician exactly what you want to get out of your facial, and she/he will be able to recommend a facial to meet your needs.</p>     
 					 </div>      
  	  	         	  <h3>Preparing for a facial (time, etc)</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Most basic facials last 60 minutes. Be sure to allow enough time to fill out a comprehensive intake prior to your treatment. Plan to arrive a little early so you will not feel rushed and can enjoy the entire length of your treatment. Remember that your hair may become damp during the facial, and will usually be held back from your face with a soft wrap or headband, so you may not want to schedule a public appearance right after your facial! There is no need to remove your makeup prior to the appointment, as it will be cleansed off during the facial.</p> 
 					 </div>  	  	         	   
  	  	         	  <h3>Facial. What to expect ?</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Facials are generally very relaxing and soothing. Your esthetician will explain to you what the treatment steps will be. Be sure to communicate with your esthetician during the facial if any product burns, itches, or if you need anything or have any questions. Otherwise, just lie back and enjoy the experience. A basic facial generally includes the following steps:</p> 
  					  <ul>
  					  	<li>Makeup removal and cleansing of the skin.</li>
  					  	<li>Skin analysis.</li>
  					  	<li>Exfoliation by mechanical, enzymatic or chemical means.</li>
  					  	<li>Massage of the face and neck, to aid in relaxation and stimulate blood and oxygen flow to the skin.</li>
  					  	<li>Extraction of blackheads and other impurities, either manually (using gloved hands and cotton or tissue around the fingers with gentle pressure to remove the impacted pore) or using a metal extraction implement designed to clear blocked pores. This can also include the use of a lancet (a small, sharp blade to lift the dead cells of the skin prior to extraction).</li>
  					  	<li>Application of products targeted to your skin type (dry, oily, mixed, sensitive, or mature).</li> 
  					  </ul>
 					 </div> 
  	  	         	  <h3>After the facial</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>After a facial, your skin will probably be soft, smooth and well hydrated. However, if multiple extractions were needed or if you required a fair amount of exfoliation, your face may be somewhat rosy for one to two hours or more, depending on how sensitive your skin is. This is quite normal. You can apply mineral makeup after your facial if there is some
					  redness you want to conceal.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	  <h3>What are the benefits of a facial ?</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Basic facials deeply cleanse skin and may help fight certain skin problems, such as mild acne or dryness. The treatments leave faces glowing and are typically very relaxing, as they include a massage component.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	  <h3>Is there a facial that can help wrinkles ?</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Basic facials may temporarily improve skin, but they can't treat severe skin issues, including wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and anything more than very mild acne. Those skin concerns typically require more intensive solutions, such as chemical peels, microdermabrasions, or collagen-inducing laser treatments.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div>  	  	         	  
  	  	         	  <h3>What about home care?</h3>
  					 <div>
  					  <p>Your esthetician will go over which professional home care products for you to continue the improvement in your skin following your professional treatment. This way, you will be using products that maximize benefits and prolong the effects of your treatment. Your therapist can explain how, when and how much of the products to use. Feel free to call the therapist
					  later, if you have any questions.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	  <h3> What is microdermabrasion ? Benefits..</h3>    	         	      	 
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Microdermabrasion is a method of exfoliation that uses a machine to remove dead surface skin cells and initiate cellular turnover. It was first adopted in Europe in the 1980s and was introduced to the United States in the late 1990s. Its introduction led the revolution of device-driven, noninvasive cosmetic procedures.</p><p> Today, microdermabrasion remains one of the most popular services employed in both medical and day spas. The two most common methods are crystal and diamond. The crystal method uses a wand
					  which sprays fine crystals onto the skin, loosening and removing dead skin cells, while simultaneously using vacuum suction to remove the used crystals and dead skin. It has been compared to a mild “sandblasting” of the skin. 
					  </p><p>The diamond method uses a diamondtipped wand to sand and resurface the skin, combined with suction to remove the dead skin cells. Both methods stimulate blood circulation and revitalize collagen production, which promotes younger-looking skin. The degree of exfoliation depends on the number of passes, level of crystal spray or coarseness of the diamond wand, the pressure and suction used, and the frequency of treatment.</p> 
 	  	         	  <p>Microdermabrasion can be helpful to treat aging and sun-damaged skin, altered pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles, stretch marks, and some types of acne and acne scarring. </p><p>It is especially effective in treating the under-eye area and crow’s feet. Results may include improved skin tone, reduced visual appearance of aging, fewer breakouts, diminished appearance of scars, refined skin pores, renewed elasticity, and a healthy glow. Microdermabrasion may be recommended for those with chemical sensitivities and can be used on most skin colors and types, although there are some contraindications. Ask your skin care professional if microdermabrasion is right for you.</p> 
  	  	         	 
  	  	         	 </div>  
  	  	         	   <h3> Preparing for microdermabrasion...</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>The procedure is noninvasive and requires little preparation. You may remove your makeup and come to the treatment room with a clean face, or allow your skin care professional to remove your makeup for you.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div>  
  	  	         	   <h3>Microdermabrasion. What to expect ?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Most clients do not find the procedure to be painful, and it requires no anesthetic. The esthetician will instruct you to relax as she applies the wand to your face in a slow, methodical way. One microdermabrasion treatment should take 30 minutes to an hour. There are no side effects, and your skin will look glowing and fresh almost immediately after the treatment.</p><p> Some more aggressive treatments may cause the skin to look slightly pink and tender for a few hours afterward. You can resume normal activities and apply makeup and moisturizer directly after your microdermabrasion session.
					  </p>  
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	   <h3>Home care after microdermabrasion</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Because fresh skin has been newly exposed, it is important to apply sunscreen and to avoid direct sunlight and tanning booths following your session. Also, avoid products containing harsh chemicals, dyes, or perfumes until the skin has fully healed. Your skin care professional will explain the home care regimen that is right for you, and send you home with written instructions.  
					  </p>  
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	    <h3>I’ve never been waxed before. How is it done?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Waxing is the most common method of hair removal in spas today. Hair on any part of the body or face can be waxed. Warm wax is applied to the area and then removed, bringing the hair with it. There are two types of wax: hard and soft. Hard wax, which is easier on delicate skin, is often used on the face, underarms, and bikini area.</p><p> Soft wax is used on the legs, arms, back, and chest. Waxing reduces hair growth when performed at regular 30-day intervals. Because waxing pulls the hair out by the root, it grows back softer, finer, and thinner. The more you wax, the less hair grows back.</p> <p>Waxing should not be performed if you have particularly sensitive skin, because it pulls off a couple of layers of skin cells along with the hair. Waxing can cause tenderness and swelling. In addition, some medications will cause the skin to react badly to waxing. Don’t wax if you’re taking Retin-A, Accutane, or any type of acne prescription.</p>    	  	         	 
  	  	         	 </div>   	  	         	   
  	  	         	    <h3>Preparing for a waxing</h3>     	 
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Let the hair grow out to about a half-inch above the skin. If hairs are too short, the wax won’t adhere strongly enough to pull them out. Refrain from taking a shower or bath before the treatment. Soaking the hair will soften it, allowing it to break more easily and making waxing less effective. Do not apply lotion to the skin before your waxing session.</p>  
  	  	         	 </div>    	  	         	   
  	  	         	    <h3>Waxing: What to expect ?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>An antiseptic lotion may be applied to cleanse the area first. Some estheticians apply a light dusting of baby powder to be sure the skin is dry before applying the wax.</p>  
 	  	         	 <ul>
 	  	         	 	<li>If soft wax is being used, the warm wax will be spread on the hairs in a thin layer. A cloth strip (muslin or pellon) is then applied to the wax, and rubbed in the direction of hair growth. The strip is then pulled quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth while the skin is held taut with the other hand.</li>
 	  	         	 	<li>If hard wax is being used, a thicker amount of warm wax is applied and allowed to dry. No cloth strip is applied. The wax is flicked to allow the esthetician to grip it, and it is then pulled off quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth. Hard wax doesn’t adhere to the skin as much as soft wax, and is therefore used on more delicate areas such as the bikini area, underarms and face.</li>  	  	         	 	 
 	  	         	 </ul>
  	  	         	 </div>   	  	         	  
  	  	         	    <h3>How much does it hurt ?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div> 
  					  <p>Most people tolerate it well, and get used to the sensation after a few treatments. The level of discomfort you will feel depends on your level of pain tolerance in general, and on which area is being waxed. If you still find waxing very uncomfortable after several treatments, many estheticians offer numbing crèmes that can be applied 45 minutes prior to the service.</p><p> Clients are also recommended to take two ibuprofen tablets prior to their appointment, to reduce discomfort and decrease inflammation in the post-waxed area. For women, it is generally best not to schedule waxing services just prior to or during your period, as you are more sensitive to pain at this time and will experience more discomfort.</p>  
  	  	         	 </div>   	  	         	    
  	  	         	    <h3>Home care after waxing</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>It’s important to care for the waxed area properly after treatment to prevent ingrown hairs, breakouts, or other reactions. Exfoliation, using a pumice stone or exfoliating gloves with a bath gel, will help keep the skin clear. Avoid using a bar soap because it leaves a film on the body that could cause ingrown hairs.</p><p> For the face, back, and chest, use a more gentle exfoliant and an anti-breakout lotion (ask your waxer about recommended products). Directly after waxing, avoid direct sunlight and tanning booths, especially while the skin is still red from treatment. For 24 hours after waxing, avoid exercise, hot tubs, and products with harsh chemicals, perfumes, or dyes. Apply a gentle moisturizer 24 hours after treatment.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	  	  <h3>What causes acne? How can skin care treatments help?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Acne is the most common skin disorder, and 85 percent of all Americans will experience it some time in their lifetime. While commonly thought to be an adolescent problem, it can appear at any age, most often on the face, back, and chest. </p>  
 	  	         	  <p>The causes of acne are complex, but usually involve the overproduction of oil, the blockage of follicles that release the oil, and the growth of bacteria in those follicles. This can be triggered by many things, including a change in medications or a change in hormone levels caused by stress or other factors. It’s important to treat acne early to avoid scarring.</p> 
 	  	         	  <p>There are 4 grades of acne. Grade 1 is the mildest form, with open and closed comedones (whiteheads and blackheads). Grades 2 and 3 include papules and pustules as well. Grade 4 is the most advanced form, with all the above plus the appearance of cysts or nodules beneath the skin surface, that can be dime size or larger and often require medical attention to treat. Acne is not only painful but can be very emotionally and psychologically challenging
					  as well. </p>  
  	  	         	 </div>  
  	  	         	   <h3>What is rosacea, and how is it treated ?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Rosacea (rose-AY-sha) is a chronic skin disease that causes varying degrees of redness and swelling, primarily on the face, but also at times on the scalp, neck, ears, chest, and back. It is considered a vascular disorder (a disorder of the blood vessels).</p><p> The condition can develop over a long period of time and is more common in adults, particularly those with fair skin. More women get it than men, though in men the condition is often more pronounced. Severe, untreated rosacea can lead to a disfigurement of the
					  nose called rhinophyma.</p>  
	  	         	  <p>There are four grades of rosacea:</p>
 	  	         	 <ul>
 	  	         	 	<li>Grade 1: Mostly redness.</li>
 	  	         	 	<li>Grade 2: Pimples and other blemishes.</li>
 	  	         	 	<li>Grade 3: Edemas (swelling due to fluid retention) and inflammatory bumps on the nose.</li>
 	  	         	 	<li>Grade 4: Symptoms affecting the eyes.</li>
 	  	         	 </ul>
 	  	         	 <p>No one knows the cause of rosacea, but it is thought to run in families and can be aggravated by environmental factors and diet. Although rosacea can be accompanied by pustules, it is not acne. Researchers believe rosacea might be caused by several things: abnormal function of the blood vessels, sun damage, and an abnormal inflammatory reaction.</p>
 	  	         	 <p>People with rosacea often learn that certain things trigger their flare-ups. It is believed that fluctuations in temperature (especially extreme heat or cold) is a common trigger. Spicy foods and alcohol consumption can also cause flare-ups.</p> 
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	   <h3>How is rosacea treated ?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
					  <p>The key to rosacea treatment is to catch it early. It may start with skin that merely flushes red. Reducing skin temperature and calming the skin is usually the first objective. Once inflammation is under control, other treatments follow. There are many treatments, including topical agents containing azelaic or lactic acid or the antibiotic metronidazole.  Both have proven helpful in relieving the symptoms of rosacea. Your physician may also prescribe internal antibiotics in the tetracycline family.</p>
					  <p> Esthetically, rosacea is treated with chemical exfoliation, ultrasonic treatments, and calming, soothing, hydrating treatments. While not a cure, any of these treatments can help control symptoms, sometimes for several years. Self-treatment is not advised, beyond a simple and gentle cleansing routine. Some over-the-counter remedies may actually worsen symptoms, as will aggressive scrubbing and rubbing.</p>   
  	  	         	 </div> 
  	  	         	   <h3>What are antiaging treatments?</h3>     	
  	  	         	 <div>
  					  <p>Thanks to the wonders of science, and innovation by skin care professionals, you can choose from a wide range of antiaging treatments. You need not have wrinkles or discoloration to actively participate in an antiaging regime—many smart consumers begin caring for and protecting their skin at a young age. Consumers today are opting for minimally invasive procedures to avoid downtime and the unmistakable appearance of having had surgery. People may notice after treatments with your skin care professional you simply seem healthier, happier, less tired, and more confident.
