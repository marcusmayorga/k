                	 <p>I started my career in the beauty industry years ago when I started working for Clinique, that is where I became fascinated with treating skin concerns, applying and giving tips during make up applications and sharing my knowledge with others. I knew I wanted to continue to learn beyond the cosmetic counter, so I decided to go back to school to become an esthetician. I attended Bellus Academy in Poway and graduated as a Certified MUD Makeup Artist and Esthetician. Since then I have continued to attend trainings anywhere from skin to lashes.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>For all my facial treatments I use a natural fruit enzyme based skincare line called Skin Script Rx, which is dedicated to beautiful, healthy skin. It uses a combination of fruit enzymes, retinols, glycolics, lactics, salicylics and natural lighteners / brighteners allowing you to receive a custom fit treatment based off your needs.</p>
