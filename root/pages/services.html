            <p>Ever wondered what the bumps on the back of your arms are called? ‘Keratosis Pilaris’ is their technical name. These tiny little bumps that look like goose bumps form when too much keratin builds up in the skin’s hair follicles. This gives skin a bumpy texture. They can also look red in appearance. During microdermabrasion exfoliating crystals and a vacuum action help to remove the build up.</p>

            <p>If you're a performer, stage makeup is essential. The bright stage lights will wash out your skin tone and obscure your facial features, and stage makeup is applied to prevent that from happening. The way you put on makeup for the stage is a lot different than your everyday makeup, though. The results may seem pretty dramatic in the mirror, but onstage it looks flattering and makes you easily recognizable from a distance.</p>
